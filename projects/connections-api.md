**API:** [GitHub](https://github.com/dawidmarek95x/nodejs-hw-rest-api)

## Technologies

Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JavaScript, JWT, dotenv, Passport, Multer, Gravatar, Jimp, SendGrid, Joi, Morgan, Docker, Jest

## Requirements

Create a server based on the REST API methodology that allows you to register and authenticate users via [JSON Web Token](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) and manage their data and individual sets of contacts stored in the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. Use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to work with the database, [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer), [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) and [Gravatar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gravatar) to work with photo files, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to work with the REST API, [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) package for additional validation, and to create unit tests use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest). Use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) service to create user email verification after registration. Use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) platform to create the application's Dockerfile.
