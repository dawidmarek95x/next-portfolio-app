## Technologies

React, Redux, React Router, JavaSript, Styled-Components, SASS, HTML5

## Requirements
Refactoring the application code ([link](https://github.com/dawidmarek95x/goit-react-hw-07-phonebook)) so that the application cooperates with the backend for user registration and logging as well as working with private contact collections ([Connections API](https://connections-api.herokuapp.com/docs/#/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C/get_users_current)). CreateAsyncThunk or RTK Query from the React Toolkit library had to be used to work with the backend and asynchronous queries. Adding routing to login, register and contacts.
